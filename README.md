## Difference between blueprint and house

### Blueprint as Protocol:

A protocol in computer science is a set of rules and conventions that govern communication between devices or systems. It establishes the standards that must be followed to achieve successful interaction.
In this context, a blueprint would be similar to a protocol. It provides a structure and a detailed guide on how communication or interaction should take place between software components or systems.

### House as Implementation:

Implementation refers to the practical realization of a set of rules or a protocol. In the field of computer science, implementation would be the actual code or the built system that adheres to the rules set by the protocol.
In this analogy, the house would represent the concrete implementation of a system based on the protocol. The house is the end product, built in accordance with the detailed specifications in the protocol (or plan).

In summary, the protocol (or plan) establishes the rules and structure for interaction, while the implementation (or house) is the practical application of those rules. This analogy is commonly used in software development, where protocols, standards, and specifications define how systems should behave, and the implementation is the actual code that follows those rules.
